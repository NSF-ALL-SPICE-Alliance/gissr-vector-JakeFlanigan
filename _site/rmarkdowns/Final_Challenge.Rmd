Your final challenge in this course is to choose a location that is important to you and to produce maps that illustrate aspects of sustainability and/or resilience in that location. Each map should tell a story that will inspire people to take action to increase sustainability/resilience in your chosen location. 

This final project can be in any language you are comfortable using. I would love to see projects in your native language if it is not English! If you need help translating the text in your maps, please reach out to the instructor.

## Target Area

Choose a location that is *meaningful to you*. This can be where you currently live, your hometown, where your family is from, etc. I recommend choosing a location that is larger than a neighborhood and smaller than a large country (e.g. United States, China).

All of your maps will show data related to this target area, though maps may be at different scales depending on the available data.

## Sustainability and Resilience Topics

You may choose any topics related to sustainability and/or resilience that you are interested in and that *you can quickly find data for*; you want to focus most of your time on building, improving, and interpreting your maps, not on finding, cleaning, and wrangling data.

I recommend using APIs for OpenStreetMap and/or iNaturalist for your first two required maps, since you already know how to use them to retrieve data, and they should have at least some data available for your location. 

## The Assignment

### Step 1: Edit this RMarkdown ("Final_Challenge.Rmd)

Leave these instructions at the bottom of your .rmd until you have finished the rest of the assignment, so you can easily refer to them. 

Fill out the YAML header with your project title, your name, and choose a theme that you like. See this [guide](https://rpubs.com/ranydc/rmarkdown_themes) for help with setting a theme.

I recommend a title like this: "Topic1 and Topic2 in Location", where you fill in the topics you cover and the location you choose.

Use this [guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) for help with formatting your RMarkdown, for example, using bold or italics, creating headers, adding images, etc.

### Step 2: Create your sections

Each section should have a header with the title of the section. This will organize your project, and will automatically fill your table of contents. 

Start with an introduction section, which includes an introduction to yourself, the location you are focused on, and the topics you will cover. **Include a locator map to familiarize the reader with your target area.**

Create a separate section for each topic you will cover. Include an image showing which SDG is related to this topic. Each section will have at least one map (you will add your maps later in step 4.

### Step 3: Code setup

Add your "setup" code chunk just below the YAML header. This is where you will load all of your libraries and set any global options (add them as you need them for your data retrieval and maps). You can also make #comments about the libraries and code you use below. You want someone to be able to recreate your maps and use your code to create their own.

### Step 4: Create your sustainability and resilience maps

Using what you have learned so far in this course, create at least one "static" map and one "interactive" map for your chosen location. Start with just a rough draft. You are welcome to create more than two maps, but start with two and complete steps 5 and 6 for those before you add any more. 

Don't reinvent the wheel if you don't have to. Use the code we have practiced with to get started, and alter the code for your location and topic. If you have draft maps from our previous exercises that work for this, use those! If you can find code online that is similar to what you want to do, use it!

### Step 5: Interpret and explain your maps

Add text above and below your map that explains what we can see in the data. This is your explanation and interpretation of the data. 

This should include:

- Where the data came from
- Interesting patterns in the data
- Limitations of the data
- Recommendations for the community to improve sustainability/resilience based on the data (call to action)

### Step 6: Improve your maps

Use everything you have learned about cartographic design to improve your maps. Each map should include a title and a legend. 

You may want to experiment with different highlighted elements, color schemes, classification/symbology schemes, base maps, contextual data, themes, coordinate reference systems, and other elements. You may want to add a note with metadata, such as author (that's you!), data source, date of publication, explanatory text, etc. You may also want to simplify your map by removing certain elements to make it more clear. 

Your goal for each map is to make it *clear, clean, and telling one story* to your reader. 

### Step 7: Make more maps

If you have time, try to make more maps and follow the instructions for steps 4-6 for each one.

### Step 8: Clean up your R Markdown 

Check for spelling and formatting mistakes, add more explanatory text, make sure you are telling a story in each section that will lead people to take action based on your map. 

### Step 9: Push your final version to GitHub with a commit message saying "Finished Final Challenge."

## After the Challenge: Additional Resources

My hope is that after completing this course, you have some ideas about what you would like to learn next. 

Here is a list of resources to help you continue your geospatial data journey:

* [Spatial Data Science with R and “terra”](https://rspatial.org) Free tutorials. "These resources teach spatial data analysis and modeling with R. R is a widely used programming language and software environment for data science. R also provides unparalleled opportunities for analyzing spatial data and for spatial modeling."
* [Spatial Data Science](https://r-spatial.org/book/) Free ebook. "This book introduces and explains the concepts underlying spatial data: points, lines, polygons, rasters, coverages, geometry attributes, data cubes, reference systems, as well as higher-level concepts including how attributes relate to geometries and how this affects analysis. ... The book aims at data scientists who want to get a grip on using spatial data in their analysis. To exemplify how to do things, it uses R."
* [Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R](https://walker-data.com/census-r/index.html) Free ebook. Check out the rest of this book (we only covered a few chapters) for lots of great ideas for using US Census data. "Census data is widely used in the United States across numerous research and applied fields, including education, business, journalism, and many others. Until recently, the process of working with US Census data has required the use of a wide array of web interfaces and software platforms to prepare, map, and present data products. The goal of this book is to illustrate the utility of the R programming language for handling these tasks, allowing Census data users to manage their projects in a single computing environment."
